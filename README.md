# MPB_Machu-Pichu-Bank
A web application that allows people to register, modify, and delete accounts. You can also request and pay money to other people's banks.

A quick thing to note, this web app will be made in NodeJS with proper authentication as its goal. We will use MongoDB CE as a document structured database and JWT (JSON WEB TOKEN) to authenticate. Sounds good!
